# Collection Log Task Generator
A plugin that allows you to generate a task to complete based on your current collection log.

## Usage
Before this plugin can be used, the [Collection Log Plugin](https://github.com/evansloan/collection-log) must be downloaded and set up in order to gather your collection log data.

You do not need to enable uploading your data to their [site](https://collectionlog.net/) for this plugin to work.

In the in-game settings, you must enable the `Collection log - New addition notification` for auto-completing tasks.

### Generate a task
* Download and set up the Collection Log [Plugin](https://github.com/evansloan/collection-log)
* In the configurations, select how you want the task generator to operate (excluding pets, rare drops, etc)
* Once you have your configurations set, navigate to the sidebar and click the circular button
* If you have the auto-complete setting on, you're all done! The generator will automatically generate a new task once you finish. If you want to manually complete a task, click the check mark icon in the top right.
